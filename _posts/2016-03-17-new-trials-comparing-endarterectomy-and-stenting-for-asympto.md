New Trials Comparing Endarterectomy and Stenting for Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis

In the March 17, 2016 edition of the NEJM two large randomized trials reported on findings of endarterectomy vs. stenting - the trials are called Asymptomatic Carotid
Trial (ACT I) and the Carotid Revascularization
Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST). They both showed that in the case of asymptomatic stenosis, the risk of ipsilateral stroke was similar at 5 years between the surgical vs. stenting arms. These trials seem to affirm the long-term safety of stents in the setting of late ipsilateral stroke. Application of these trial data to individual patients, at individual centers is more complex. The trials used a 'credentialing' method to ensure that the operators (surgeons and neuro-interventionists) were maximally competent - a factor that would reduce the general applicability of these findings to all centers but would study the effect of the intervention more accurately if more experienced center's data were included with less experienced (less volume) centers. Challenges in applying these trial data to real-life scenarios and patients, with different degrees of asymptomatic stenosis will remain a challenge!
