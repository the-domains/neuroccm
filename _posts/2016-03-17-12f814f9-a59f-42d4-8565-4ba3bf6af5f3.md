Welcome to neuroccm.org -- developed by Houman Khosravani MD PhD FRCPC. I am an internist/intensivist who is interested in neurocritical care. This site is dedicated to fostering learning, discussion, and interest in all things critical care and neurocritical care, with the latter being an area of focus. At times, we will discuss related fields such as neurology, neuroscience, neurophysiology, and computation as they apply to critical care and neurocritical care. neuroccm.org aims to build on the numerous and excellent resources already available on the web (Free Open Access Meducation, \#FOAMed) -- for a list of these resources, please see the Education section of the site. For more junior resident/off-service ICU education, please see my ICU education site [ecriticalcare.org][0] from Critical Care Western, under the section [ICU Boot Camp][1].

The topics discussed on this site are by no means the end-all or definitive write-up of a topic, but rather represent a perspective of a critical care physician/neuroscientist with an interest in neurocritical care. If you are interest in contributing to neuroccm.org as a contributing author/faculty, then please[contact me][2].

Just "[one more thing][6]", FOAM represents a revolution in medical education that is born out of the interface between technological advancement and medical education. Given the number of medical experts with technological know-how, FOAM should also represent a movement by which physicians and other healthcare practitioners augment and develop software solutions to medical challenges -- it's time for all of us to push the envelop in technology in our field and take back direction in software development to help our patients and work-flow. This website will also be dedicated to this -- to foster discussion, ideas and to bring forth new ideas on how to apply computational solutions to the care of critically-ill patients. Arguably, critical care and neurocritical care, are ideal branches of medicine where monitoring/sensors, computation, and therapeutics come together...and herein, it's our vision to advance this cause.
