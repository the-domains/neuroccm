**A) [eCriticalCare.org][0]**

[eCriticalCare.org][0]is an Education portal that I developed for Western University's Division of Critical Care Medicine. Our goal is to provide educational resources that will be useful to our trainees who rotate through our ICUs. From an ICU education perspective, our target audience are Junior residents who rotate through our ICUs, which is why we have called our introductory course ICU Boot Camp. We hope that this resource will be useful to starting residents at other centres as well and as part of the larger online community of \#FOAMed.

**B) Critical Care / Emergency Medicine / Prehospital and Retrieval Medicine**

The following are absolutely excellent websites & podcasts by various CCM/ED/IM attending staff or trainees from across the world with topical reviews and commentaries. They are listed in no particular order but each site has very unique and relevant sources so please take time to explore them.

This page is a collection of online resources in accordance with the principles of the FOAM (Free Open Access Med-education) community. There are both internal and external links to documents, podcasts, and other resources. Feel free to comment and provide feedback, especially if you find an error or omission!
